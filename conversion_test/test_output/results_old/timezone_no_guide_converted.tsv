1. **Identify Time Zones**: 
   - Zhemuzhen is in China, and assuming it follows Beijing time, it is in the UTC+8 timezone.
   - Noorabad is likely referring to a place in Iran or another country with a similar name. Noorabad (Delfan) in Iran is in the UTC+3:30 timezone.

2. **Calculate Time Difference**:
   - The difference between UTC+8 and UTC+3:30 is 4 hours and 30 minutes.

3. **Convert Time**:
   - To convert 3PM (15:00) from UTC+8 to UTC+3:30, subtract 4 hours and 30 minutes.
   - 15:00 - 4:30 = 10:30 AM
