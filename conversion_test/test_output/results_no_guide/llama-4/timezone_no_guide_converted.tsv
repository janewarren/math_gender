Kafue is in Zambia, which is in the Central African Time (CAT) zone, UTC+2. Lavrentiya is likely referring to Lavrentiya, a settlement in Russia, which is in the Magadan Time (MAGT) zone, UTC+11, but without more specific information, we'll assume it's in a timezone that needs to be identified. However, given the context, it seems we need to establish the offset between the two locations.

## Step 2: Determine the timezone offset between Kafue and Lavrentiya
Assuming Kafue is UTC+2 and if we consider Lavrentiya to be in a timezone like MAGT (UTC+11), the offset would be +9 hours from Kafue.

## Step 3: Apply the timezone offset to the given time
To convert 6:58PM (CAT, UTC+2) to Lavrentiya time (assuming UTC+11), we add 9 hours to 6:58PM.

## Step 4: Calculate the new time
6:58PM + 9 hours = 3:58AM (next day).

## Step 5: Format the result
The time in Lavrentiya would be 3:58AM.

The final answer is: $\boxed{3:58AM}$"	6:58PM	599.0

Lleida is a city in Spain, which is in the Central European Time (CET) timezone, UTC+1.

Nagai is a city in Japan, which is in the Japan Standard Time (JST) timezone, UTC+9.

The difference between CET (UTC+1) and JST (UTC+9) is 8 hours.
